# m4LLooping
A collection of looping M4L devices.

Require Max 8 to run, as they make use of MC objects.

## Lento

A granular synthesis based looper that allows the user to slow down and freeze the playback of real-time recorded audio loops.

## Pixel 

A spectral processing based looper that allows the user to separate an audio signal into 8 spectral frequency bands and loop them in independently sized looping buffers. It also allows the user to change the speed/pitch and playback direction of each loop.

Requires the following patchers to be in the same folder: 
- spec-unit.maxpat
- band-sep.maxpat
